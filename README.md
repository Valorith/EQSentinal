# What

EQSentinel is a tool that constantly monitors your selected EQ log and reports back if any keywords are detected in a log entry, in real time. Keywords/phrases can be add/removed from within the CLI.

More functionality will be added to allow users to select various actions (i.e. notifications, sounds, etc) that will trigger when keywords are detected.
